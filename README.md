# Async_RandomWords
Application that runs random word finder asynchronously.

To run: Simply run the .EXE file

You are prompted to enter a word, only up to 5 characters MAXIMUM (the word finder will take days to finish above this number). Can be your name, or gibberish.
The application will asynchronously run the search and it won't hang the program while search is still ongoing. Therefore, you can enter another word for another search in the meantime and it won't interfere with the application or any concurrent searches!

Will display the random generation attempts to find word and the time it took doing so.

** AGAIN, NO WORDS ABOVE 5 LETTERS!
